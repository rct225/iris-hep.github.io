&lt;!--more--&gt;
Four instructors from ATLAS, two from Software Carpentries, and two from IRIS-HEP were involved, along with five helpers from ATLAS, providing a 4:1 student to instructor ratio to be maintained at all times with the 31 students. This five day training event taught four basic computing skills: version control, build systems, continuous integration/testing, and containers. Each morning session was followed up by an ATLAS specific lesson in the afternoon over that topic. For the final half-day, instructors proposed a set of topics and the students voted on them; the top three topics were then taught in parallel sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback from the workshop was overwhelmingly positive. All 31 students completed both the preworkshop and postmortum surveys. The gender makeup was 63% male and 37% female. 90% were PhD students. In all areas, student self-identification of skill levels increased dramatically after the bootcamp. Before starting, well over half of the students did not know how to use CMake to build a C++ project; but after the bootcamp, over 90% identified as at least half way to an expert (and 0% identified as a beginner). Using Continuous integration for Analysis was even slightly better (due at least in part to a universally praised session on ATLAS CI by Giordon Stark), with containers and version control increases only slightly behind. Around 90% were interested or possibly interested in helping out at a similar event in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students had a great time and built connections to other ATLAS collaborators and with several IRIS-HEP members; everyone said they met at least four new collaboration members. Several social activities were planned, such as a pizza lunch, two dinners at a local restaurants, and a visit to the Berkeley Bowl; a nearby supermarket that has become a local favorite. A couple of hours one day were set aside for a career panel, where students heard from six people from careers after working on ATLAS or anther HEP experiment that live in the Bay area. 77% of the participants believed this was “Very Useful”, with 68% of the participants saying that their perspective on potential career paths after grad school were changed as a result of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The material from the workshop is available online. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://smeehan12.github.io/2019-08-19-usatlas-computing-bootcamp/&quot;&gt;workshop website&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://indico.cern.ch/event/816946/&quot;&gt;Indico page&lt;/a&gt; are excellent places to go to find out more about the material taught in workshop, including the pre-workshop setup and installation guides.

of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez took place on 24-26
April, 2019, organized by IRIS-HEP Training, Education and Outreach

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical
model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on
the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and
make decisions with minimal human intervention.  While many machine
learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability
to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big
data repeatedly and ever faster is a recent development. Learning
these skill would make it possible to quickly and automatically
produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver
faster, more accurate results. The potential for using ML techniques 
encompasses all STEM fields. Learning ML tools early on can be
very useful in a number of career paths and thus there is a great demand
for opportunities such as this hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diyaselis Delgado López, a UPRM physics undergraduate student who 
participated, was surprised and excited about what she learned: “Thanks to 
this experience, I definitely want to investigate further and use these 
techniques in everything I can.” Ricardo González, another physics undergrad 
at UPRM, also participated in the Hackathon. He felt that attending the 
Hackathon was extremely valuable “because it opened my eyes to a powerful tool 
that physicists have within our reach. Soon I will become a graduate student, 
and I am now looking for ways to incorporate what I have learned here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hackathon &lt;a href=&quot;https://indico.cern.ch/event/809812/timetable/&quot;&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; 
included talks by UPRM researchers and faculty from the Mathematics, Physics
and CS&amp;amp;E departments. Topics included covered Statistics, ML
techniques and use cases from research activities at UPRM. &lt;a href=&quot;http://sergeigleyzer.com&quot;&gt;Dr. Sergei
Gleyzer&lt;/a&gt;, a physicist from University of Florida and convener of ML group at 
the CMS Experiment at CERN, also participated as a lecturer and facilitator. 
The participants were students from UPRM who were given challenging 
problem to solve during Hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The very first Machine Learning Hackathon at the Physics Department of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez took place on 24-26 April, 2019, organized by IRIS-HEP Training, Education and Outreach coordinator (and UPRM physics professor) Sudhir Malik.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">NSF funds IRIS-HEP project to address the massive data demands from the upgraded Large Hadron Collider</title><link href="http://iris-hep.org/2018/09/04/iris-hep-project-funded.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NSF funds IRIS-HEP project to address the massive data demands from the upgraded Large Hadron Collider" /><published>2018-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://iris-hep.org/2018/09/04/iris-hep-project-funded</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://iris-hep.org/2018/09/04/iris-hep-project-funded.html">&lt;p&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF) has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=296456&amp;amp;org=NSF&amp;amp;from=news&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; the Institute

&lt;p&gt;IRIS-HEP will address key elements of the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982&quot;&gt;“Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&amp;amp;D for the 2020s”&lt;/a&gt;

Innovation Institute (S2I2) for High Energy Physics”&lt;/a&gt;
submitted to the NSF in December 2017.
These two documents represent, respectively, the outcome of international 
and U.S. HEP community planning processes; these were driven in part
by the NSF-funded &lt;a href=&quot;http://s2i2-hep.org&quot;&gt;S2I2-HEP Institute Conceptualization Project&lt;/a&gt;.
Over the course of a dozen workshops during 2016 and 2017, more than 260
scientists and engineers from around the world were involved in building this community vision.&lt;/p&gt;
